# Android Studio

Using Android Studio

## codeWithAninda

Used Android studio, a week ago, to create the first android app. Completely forgot about what I did. I would try  to recollect and write down some details later

## CurrencyConverter

Created that on the first day, got errors and later got frustrated. So, today, I have deleted the project to help me not to get into the frustration of fixing the codes again. Now, that I write about it, it seems that sometimes fixing could prove good. This is my vacation time and hence taking it easy.

## MaulikConvertsCurrency

Initialised today. Important points would be noted down here.
